# Workflow Templates Overview

Workflow templates are reusable GitHub Action workflows that help streamline common CI/CD tasks across multiple repositories. These templates make it easy to standardize workflows, reduce redundancy, and maintain consistency in build, test, and deployment processes.

Each workflow template in this repository serves a specific purpose, such as running security checks, performing linting, or executing unit tests. The templates can be customized to meet the needs of individual projects while retaining a consistent structure.

## Adding Workflow Templates

To add a workflow template to your repository, go to the Actions page of your GitHub repository. You can browse available workflow templates and easily add them by clicking 'New' and choosing a workflow from exzeo-devops. Once added, you can customize it as needed for your project.

## Updating Workflow Templates

To update an existing workflow template in your repository, navigate to the Actions page, locate the workflow you want to update, and click on 'Edit'. You can manually make changes to the workflow file or pull in the latest updates from the exzeo-devops repository if a newer version is available. Ensure you test the changes before committing them to avoid disruption in your CI/CD processes. Alternatively, you can go to 'New' and copy the contents of the latest version of the workflow from exzeo-devops to replace your current workflow.
